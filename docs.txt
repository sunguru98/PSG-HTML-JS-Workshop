2.LEARNING OUTCOMES :-
    -> Value design before quality
    -> Value team design
    -> Value software quality
    -> Value reflection
    -> Problem based Learning

3.COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS :-
    -> Acquire
    -> Represent
    -> Generate
    -> Transform
    -> Communicate

4.COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN :-
    Transforming game or any software ideas with a help of a necessary tool 
    to a breathing application.

5.USES OF COMPUTAITON :-
    -> Video games creation (computational problem solving)
    -> Information retrieval
    -> Information encryption
    -> Simulation

6.ALGORTIHM :-
    Process of converting the idea to reality

7.COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES :-
    -> Problem solving
    -> Algortihms
    -> Abstraction

8. GAME CREATION PROCESS :-
    . Create the game
       ---------------
        * Understand the game
            -> Observe It
            -> Play it
        * Create Versions
            -> Create design
                # Understand Versions
                    (.) Observe version
                    (.) Play version
                    (.) Create version description
                # Create Algorithm
            -> Create program
                # Observe version
                # Play version
                # Create version description
            -> Debug and reflect them
